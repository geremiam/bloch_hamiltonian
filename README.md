Module contains a class (magnonsystem_t) for computing the Bloch Hamiltonian of translation-invariant linear spin-wave systems. See the docstrings in the class and method definitions.

Future plans for magnonsystem_t:

 - Allow interaction terms to be specified with respect to another basis, using a rotation argument.
 - Allow separate definition of unit cell and magnetic unit cell. That way, repetitive interaction definitions are not needed.
 - Calculate the coefficients of the linear terms and check that they vanish.

Other future plans:

 - Write a class for fermion hopping problems (and possibly another for fermion superconductors).
 - Write a class for triplons.
